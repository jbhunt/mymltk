# mymltk
This is my personal machine learning (ML) toolkit that contains implementations of various ML techniques using PyTorch. So far I've implemented these techniques:
- Linear regression (via full-batch gradient descent)
- Logistic regression
- Classical (Rosenblatt) perceptron

All of my implementations have a Scikit-Learn-like interface such that they have a `fit`, `predict`, and `score` method.
